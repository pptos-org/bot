# running

- First install dart. You can read [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart) how to do so. The bot only works on linux!

- get [mediafire-dl](https://github.com/Juvenal-Yescas/mediafire-dl) and [Internet Archive CLI](https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/installation.html#binaries).

- make an .env file in the root of the bot directory and write TOKEN=YOURTOKEN in it.

- Get all of the dart dependencies (you only need to run this once): `dart pub get`

- Now you can run the bot via `dart bin/main.dart`
